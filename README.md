# Digital-Voting-System-Using-Logic-Gates


## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **simulation-based digital voting system** designed using basic digital logic components. The system ensures **one-person–one-vote** by implementing a vote-locking mechanism controlled by an authorized officer. The design focuses on correctness, simplicity, and educational value rather than large-scale deployment.



## 🎯 Key Features
- One vote per voter enforced using hardware logic  
- Officer-controlled authorization and reset mechanism  
- Separate counters for **Team 1** and **Team 2**  
- Prevention of multiple or unauthorized voting  
- Fully implemented and verified through simulation  



## 🧠 System Concept
The voting system operates in a controlled sequence:
1. The **officer enables** the voting session.
2. A voter selects **Team 1 or Team 2**.
3. The selected team’s counter increments **only once**.
4. A vote-lock disables further inputs.
5. The officer resets the system for the next voter.

This ensures fairness and eliminates duplicate votes.
